# cogni
Cogni is simple .NET library implementing MLP neural network and back-progapation training algorithm, written in .NET Core 6. Currently, the library is focused only on multi-layer perceptron networks, but the goal is to implement more kinds of neural networks available in the tool.

# Usage
To use and traing the network, one should create new MultilayerPerceptron object using MultilayerPerceptron class, like this:

```csharp
var network = MultilayerPerceptronBuilder.CreateNetwork()
        .WithLayers(new int[] {2, 5, 5, 1})
        .WithBias()
        .WithActivationFunction<SigmoidFunction>()
        .Build();
```

Now, you can use methods:
- Predict - to get value generated by network for given input
- Train - to train the network for given input and expected output
